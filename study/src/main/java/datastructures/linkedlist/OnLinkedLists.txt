LinkedLists are collections of elements or "nodes" such that each node contains a pointer or reference to the next node
in the list (singly linked list), and sometimes to the previous node too (doubly linked list). Similar to an array, but
with only sequential access instead of random access like an array - in order to reach the 4th element, you have to
iterate over the first 3. Since you have to go thru sequentially, LinkedLists are defined by their "head" aka the first
element in the list

Sometimes a linked list is "circular" meaning the "last" element in the list points to the "first" element in the list
as its next element. Of course, the words first and last mean nothing in the context of a circle but whatever - one of
the elements is always the head so...yeah.

Pretty simple as far data structures go
